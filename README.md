# Lucas Lucena

Senior Software Engineer with 6+ years of professional experience building, maintaining, and scaling backend systems in high-impact environments such as banking, fintech, and large enterprise platforms.

I specialize in **.NET ecosystem**, **cloud-native architectures on AWS**, and **clean, maintainable system design**. I’ve worked end-to-end across legacy systems, modern microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and production monitoring — always with a strong focus on reliability, performance, and business value.

Currently based in Europe, open to international and remote opportunities.
